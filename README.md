Development Approach:
            First, I identified and defined all the components required for the application. Once the components were created, I focused on mapping out the UI design requirements.
            In the header section, I implemented all the necessary fields and functionality. Following that, I created the corresponding pages for the header section within the pages folder.
            After defining all the pages in the pages folder, I implemented them using routes and NavLink to enable navigation between the pages.
